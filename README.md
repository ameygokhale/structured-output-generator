## Why This Matters

These examples demonstrate practical prompt engineering skills:

- Designing prompts that **control output structure**
- Producing **predictable, reusable results**
- Converting unstructured text into formats suitable for automation
- Applying prompt engineering to real business use cases

The focus of this project is **reliability and structure**, not creative generation.
